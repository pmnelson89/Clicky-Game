# Clicky-Game

# Overview

This memory game was built with Create React App.  It randomly displays images of Formula 1 drivers and asks the player to click on the images.  Each time a driver is clicked, the player will earn a point and the order of the images will randomize.  If a driver is selected more than once, the player's score will reset to 0.
